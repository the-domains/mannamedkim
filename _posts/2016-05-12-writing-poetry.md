Writing Poetry 

Sometimes, I have an idea 

A particular phrase that gets my attention 

Or 

A bothersome feeling that just won't be captured in prose 

Then I write it down in short Broken lines and Phrases and See what comes out. 

Then it stares back at me 

Talks to me 

Calls my name or yours 

As I look at its particular shape 

Hear its weedy voice 

I might tweak a word or two to get it to look 

Or feel or sound a bit better 

As it speaks about you or me 

Our living, believing, breathing, selves 

Then I name it Poem -- Because I have to -- Then I hit post and hope it has value to someone else. 

(Because of a conversation between poets. Thank you. You know who you are.)
